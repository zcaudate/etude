* Introduction

This is [[http://github.com/zcaudate/etude][Etude]] - an /*emacs micro-framework*/ (aka /use-package + two
additional files/) with the emphasis of being highly customisable and
beginner friendly. It configures an extremely usable editor
(subjectively speaking) with the minimal amount of addons (also
subjectively speaking), creating a version ~emacs~ that is:

- [[*Simplicity][Simple]] (Visual, Intuitive, Modern)
- [[*Redundancy][Robust]] (Portable, Efficent)
- [[*Flexibility][Flexible]] (Easy to Customise, Swappability)

The aim of the project is to provide better usability for ~emacs~ on
~tmux~ sessions across various operating systems. There are three
parts to it:

1. ~elpa~ packages providing functionality /(keyboard agnostic)/
2. key bindings to those packages /(dvorak specific)/
3. a /*micro framework*/ used for binding the keys to the actual
   functionality /(keyboard agnostic)/

*So..*

/What is all this fuss around keybindings?/

The methodology used for determining keybindings is by no means
authoritative or complete. It's definitely much better described with
pictures - something that still needs to be done. One who has read
through it might point out that it's rehashing the completely
obvious. The cynical might even say that it's a long winded attempt to
justify the mutilation of a perfectly great set of defaults.

/Well... Yes./

However, doing this exercise (/etude/) provides a list of ~what is
essential~ vs ~what is not~. By writing all this down, it creates a
mental model that can be a guide for design of better ergonamics in
both Emacs and other tools to come.


* Dependencies

The framework is built around a very small core set of libraries:

- [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] (packages)
- [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy, counsel and swiper]] (search)
- [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] (gui)
- [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]], [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el][ht]], [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s]] and [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f]] (utils)

* Methodology

/*Question:*/

/How would we remap the keys if we have to start from scratch?/

/*Answer:*/

/Map the most widely used functions back to the most accessible
keys. Duh./

/*Note to Reader*/

Feel free to skip this section and go to the code itself, as the
methods outlined here doesn't have anything to do with the code. This
section is here mainly to explain how the keybindings within ~Etude~
came about.

** Overview

We're essentially dealing with an optimisation problem. We rely on two
major assumptions:

- a set of characteristics for use the Dvorak keyboard
- a set of patterns by the user.

In addition, there keys that cannot be remapped: ~C-i~, ~C-x~, ~C-g~,
~C-c~, ~C-u~ and ~C-z~. As this setup combined with ~tmux~, the ~tmux~
prefix has been remapped to ~C-<space>~, allowing ~C-a~ to be used as
a binding. Futhermore, as terminal sessions inside a remote Emacs are
preferred over nesting ~tmux~ instances, ~C-b~ (the default prefix for
nested ~tmux~'s) can also be used.


** Keyboard

The keys on the keyboard is divided up into central (~C~) or
peripheral (~P~) as well as a left (~L~) or right (~R~) marker. A key
will be given the shortform ~LC~ for left central, ~LP~ for left
peripheral, ~RC~ for right central and ~RP~ for right peripheral.

The central areas are the alphabet keys (~A-Z~), all the *big* keys
(~RET~, ~DEL~) and the arrow keys are also considered central. The
peripheral are the numbers, the ~<Fn>~ keys, and the symbol keys near
of the ~RET~. The analysis done provides a rough measure of keystroke
difficulty for the Dvorak keyboard. Qwerty keyboards can use the same
weights but the layout will be different, especially when we get to
chords.

*Note:* Arrow keys are considered central. Although there is a
movement of hand position when switching between typing and going to
the arrow keys, it corresponds to a mode change (from typing in input
to navigation). Since the requirement for a mode change is at least an
order of magnitude less than normal usage (~<many inputs>~,
~<switch>~, ~<many movements>~, ~<switch>~, ~<many inputs>~) This
switching movement is considered negligible.

*Single Keys*

The following rules apply:

1. central keys are given a weight of ~1.0~
2. peripheral keys are given a weight of ~1.3~

/Examples:/

- ~x~ gives a weight of ~1.0~.
- ~<backspace>~ gives a weight of ~1.0~
- ~<F1>~ gives a weight of ~1.3~
- ~=~ gives a weight of ~1.3~
- ~5~ gives a weight of ~1.3~

*Modifier Keys*

For a modifier enabled key, the following weights apply:

1. ~1.3~ if the next key is R central
2. ~1.5~ if the next key is L central
3. ~1.5~ if the next key is R peripheral
4. ~2.0~ if the next key is L peripheral

/Examples:/

- ~C-c~ gives a weight of ~1.3~
- ~C-x~ gives a weight of ~1.5~
- ~C-0~ gives a weight of ~1.5~
- ~C-1~ gives a weight of ~2.0~
- ~C-<F1>~ gives a weight of ~2.0~

*Escape Keys*

Escape is up in the top left hand corner. It's treatment is slightly
different:

1. ~1.5~ if the next key is L peripheral
2. ~1.8~ if the next key is R central
3. ~2.0~ if the next key is R peripheral
4. ~2.3~ if the next key is L central

/Examples:/

- ~Esc <F1>~ gives a weight of ~1.5~
- ~Esc RET~ gives a weight of ~1.8~
- ~Esc t~ gives a weight of ~2.0~
- ~Esc a~ gives a weight of ~2.3~

*Chorded Keys (~C-x~)*

Chorded keys are keys that are combined such as ~C-c C-e~ or ~C-x C-k~
and other such combinations. If we take all possible combinations of
chords, then the analysis gets complicated very quickly. However, we
know that the key chord will start either with ~C-x~ or ~C-c~ and can
begin from there. Furthermore, because ~C-c~ chords tend to be
reserved for specific modal functionality and left up to the modal
developers, we look only at ~C-x~ chords.

There is a slight difference in the ergonamics for a key chord with
repeated modifier (~C-x C-e~) and that without (~C-x e~). This is
because in the second case, one has to lift up the ~Ctrl~ key in order
to invoke the chord. The second case is slightly more difficult than
the first case.

We ignore this distinction completely in Etude. This means that ~C-x
C-c~ and ~C-x c~ will be bound to the same function. The reason to
treat ~C-x C-<key>~ and ~C-x <key>~ as the same invocation is for
robustness. This is to overcome contraints experienced over the
terminal where only a limited number of ~C-<key>~ sequences are
allowed. So typing ~C-x C-<key>~ ande ~C-x <key>~ actually become the
same thing.

An exception to this is made with arrow keys - this is the only
exception that is made due to the modal nature of movement. Such fine
grained actions are needed to add more enhanced features so that
movement across buffers and movement between windows can be
distiguished.

~x~ is located in the lower middle section of the keypad, ~C-x <L>~
keys are therefore generally difficult to access. We completely
discard ~C-x <LP>~ cases because they are too difficult to reach. The
more reliable keystrokes are of ~C-x <R>~ type. We can now provide
some weights:

1. ~1.5~ if the second key is R central
2. ~2.0~ if the second key is R peripheral
3. ~2.5~ if the second key is L central

/Examples:/

- ~C-x C-c~ gives a weight of ~1.5~
- ~C-x C-=~ gives a weight of ~2.0~
- ~C-x C-;~ gives a weight of ~2.5~


*Function Key Chords (~<Fn>~)*

TBD

** Inputs 

User inputs are classified based on usage frequency Futhermore, inputs
can be broken down into categories defining frequency of use:

1. *Actions* (*M1*): inputs used between ~1~ to ~20~ times a ~minute~
   either in bursts or during workflow.
2. *Commands* (*M2*): inputs used between ~2~ to ~60~ times an ~hour~.
3. *Tasks* (*M3*): inputs used from infrequently up to ~2~ times an
   ~hour~.

These 

*Actions*

Input
- All self inserts (Alphanumeric + Grammer)

Iterative movement
- Planar movement within the buffer or minibuffer (Up, Down, Left,
  Right)
- Lateral movement across words
- Vertical movement across paragraphs or sections
- Planar movement within windows contained within a frame
- Lateral movement between buffers

Jump movement
- Jump to line
- Jump to word
- Jump to buffer
- Jump to definition

*Commands*
- Find file
- Find recent
- Find file containing text

*Meta*
- Help for 
   - bindings
   - keys
   - 
 


*Tasks*




** Additional Considerations

*** Simplicity

- *Modern*: Repurpose unused Emacs global keys for the modern
  keyboard. For example, ~C-f~ and ~C-b~ are keys for forward and back
  and using a combination of modifier keys, allow for for incremental
  movements as well as movement and selection. Generally using arrow
  keys and the mouse /(shock horror)/ suffice and so keys bound to
  ~<C>~ that govern movement/selection can be repurposed for something
  else. For marking and rectangles, it's just much faster in general
  to select with the mouse.

- *Visual* Have a overaching way to customise mod

Emacs has become known for its infinite customisability. This causes
problems because there are too many options and too many different
teams customising. IDEs such as ~Eclipse~ and ~Visual Code~ are big
and bulky - but they have also gotten very fundamental things
right. The primary thing all IDEs have is consistent way to Run and
Debug programs. Yes, it's possible to compile your code, surf the net,
organise your holiday and message your friends without leaving Emacs
but having to run Lisp code via ~C-c C-k~ and then compiling C with
some other key binding should be a concern. Etude solves this by
enforcing a global keybindings system based on clojure's multimethod
approach to retro-fit an IDE-like interface for any major modes.


*** Redundancy

Allowing multiple ways of performing a very common task. For example,
~M-x~, which brings up the command prompt has an analogue of ~C-p~ in
Sublime Text. When in the terminal the ~Meta~ key stops
working. Sometimes people bind ~C-p~ as their prefix key on
~tmux~. Therefore having multiple ways of accessing a very commonly
used function helps a lot and increases usability.


*** Portability 

In this case, portability refers to the user. This is primarily
motivated by having to constantly switch between ~Ctrl~, ~Super~, and
~Meta~ between operating systems. In this case, certain commonly used
commands like the /Save/ operation will be bound to all three ~C-s~,
~M-s~ and ~S-s~ for consistency's sake (as well as to perform the same
action with minimal readjustment of muscle memory when a modifier key
become unusable).



*** Flexibility

A looser coupling between function implementation so that bindings and
modes can be swapped out

* Library

** Core

There are 2 file associated purely with the framework:

- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/etude-boot.el][etude-boot.el]] (to initialise ~use-package~)
- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/etude-lang.el][etude-lang.el]] (defining key binding macros)

The core libraries, loaded via [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/etude-core.el][etude-core.el]] are organised into a
couple of categories:

- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/core/etude-core-base.el][base]] (various sane defaults)
- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/core/etude-core-management.el][management]] (recentf, smex, ivy, projectile, wgrep, treemacs)
- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/core/etude-core-code.el][code]] (magit, company, eglot)
- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/core/etude-core-os.el][os]] (vterm, eshell, cut/paste)
- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/core/etude-core-style.el][style]] (nord)

** Modules

Etude also provides a very basic module system. The module libraries
are simply loaded via init.el and provide supplemental customisations
to the core. 

They can be optional. Some current ones that I'm working with are:

- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/module/etude-module-lisp.el][lisp]] (elisp, clojure)
- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/module/etude-module-org.el][org]]  (previews)
- [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/module/etude-module-text.el][text]] (yaml, markdown)

As can be seen by the listing, it's very basic. Where is comes
together is in the setup of the [[https://github.com/zcaudate/etude/blob/master/etude/core/etude-core-workflow.el][workflow]] file where the majority of it
all comes together.

** Workflow

The workflow file define bindings as well as menu layouts. These work
on a number of principles. Programmer Intent in emacs can be thought
of being Movements, Actions and Tasks. In this context both are
fundamentally the same except differ in the regularity that the are
performed (Tasks are actions that are performed less than onc). So To
be So an action like Move Forward might be used 50 times a minute, an
action like Check Git Repository might be used
